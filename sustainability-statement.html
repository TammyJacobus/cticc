                <p>The Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) strives to support the implementation of
                    events in a sustainable manner that benefits both the society in which it operates, and the
                    environment as a whole, by following a triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability: People
                    Planet
                    and Profit.</p>

                <p>Sustainabilityis the very core of the CTICC. It is the golden thread that runs through every aspect
                    of the centre: its business dealings, staff empowerment, community interactions, and care for the
                    environment.</p>
                <p>As part of a larger community, the CTICC is committed to finding long-term, sustainabile approaches
                    to conducting business and addressing social issues in the Western Cape and the country at large.

                        <p>Designed and built to connect Cape Town to the country, the centre aims to bring people
                            together through world-class events that promote economic growth and job creation.</p>
                        <p>In addition, rigorous annual assessments have tracked the progress of the CTICC's economic
                            contribution over the years. Since its opening, the CTICC has cumulatively created more than
                            115 000 jobs and has made a combined cumulative contribution to the regional and national
                            economies of moe than R40 billion.</p>
                        <p>The CTICC is also aligned to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles of human
                            rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.</p>

                <p>As sustainability is both a moral obligation and a strategic imperative, the CTICC plaes great
                    importance on integrating economic, social, and environmental sustainability into every aspect of
                    its operations. This triple-bottom-line approach is informed by a comprehensive Environmental Policy
                    and monitored by a dedicated Sustainability Committee referred to as the NOW team.</p>
                <p>The CTICC established its NOW initiative in 2009. Initially set up as a way to transform commitment
                    into practical action, NOW quickly evolved into a central component of the centre's sustainability
                    strategy. The NOW team, comprising representatives from all areas of the business, work together to
                    ensure that sustainability stays at the centre of every aspect of the CTICC.</p>
                <p>The work of the NOW team is complemented by a dedicated CTICC Sustainability Officer, who can be
                    contacted by emailing <a href="">NOW@cticc.co.za</a></p>
