                        stringent measures ot ensure the venue is a safe environment for all staff and visitors to

                    <p>We strongly recommend utilising one of the ATMs located in the CTICC to withdraw cash, rather
                        than
                        using those located on public streets in the center's vacinity, to avoid becoming the target of
                        theft syndicates active in the area.</p>
                    <p>Safely accesible ATMs are located in the foyer of the P3 parking basement and in CTICC 1 on the
